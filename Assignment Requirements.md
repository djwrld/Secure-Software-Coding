FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS USER STORIES:
1.  As a user, I want to store my credentials for servers in a file on my computer (password database), so that I can retrieve them when I need them without having to memorize every single password.
2.  As a user, I want to record the server name, username and password in the password database so I can retrieve it when I need it.
3.  As a user, I want to be able to retrieve the username and password for a server by inputting the server name only, so that I don't have to memorize the credentials and so that I can use them immediately to log into the server.
4.  As a user, I want to store up to 10 credential records in the password database, so I can store credentials for multiple servers.
5.  As a user, I want to add, update and/or delete a specific credential from the database, so that I can make sure the credentials are up-to-date.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS USER STORIES:
1.  As a user, I want to have my password database protected by a username and password for me to obtain access to the credentials, so that unauthorized people cannot access the credentials.
2.  As a user, I want to prevent myself from storing credentials for a server that already exists in the password database, so that I do not have more than one entry for a single server.
